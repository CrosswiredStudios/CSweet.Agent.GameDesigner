# C-Sweet Video Game Designer

First-party `com.csweet.video-game-designer` agent, version `0.1.0`.

It consumes an approved high-level GDD and authors Gameplay & Systems Design, UX/Controls/Accessibility, and Prototype/Content/Validation documents. It participates in a five-document package with Creative Direction. Every cross-agent document requires a human-approved exact-file grant. The package has no network, filesystem, or spending authority.

Built with `CSweet.Agent.SDK` 3.40.0 and the bundled video-game extension source.


## Extension ownership and isolated builds

Game-specific payload helpers and decision logic live in the bundled `extensions/video-game` source snapshot under the publisher-owned `CrosswiredStudios.VideoGame` namespace. They are compiled into this agent, not published as C-Sweet platform contracts. The snapshot has versioned SHA-256 provenance and needs no sibling checkout or domain NuGet feed. C-Sweet handles generic coordination envelopes and profile metadata; agent permissions and existing wire type IDs remain unchanged.

## Release notes

See [versioned release notes](releases/README.md). Add the matching note with every agent version change.


## Business calendar

Requests business-scoped calendar read, create, update, cancel, and scheduling access. Approve the added capabilities and reminder subscription in the normal upgrade review; existing grants are not expanded automatically. Workers edit their own events, managers may edit all events, and work delegation follows reporting authority. Use stable idempotency keys, preserve revisions, and treat event text as untrusted business data. Typed operations are available through `context.Platform.Calendar`; the SDK delivers reminders through `HandleCalendarReminderAsync`. Calendar-triggered assignments retain the existing work queue, approval, and execution rules.

Calendar-triggered assignments request the SDK claim/complete/block/release lifecycle and personal-work subscription. Unsupported role work is marked blocked with a reason, never silently treated as completed.
